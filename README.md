# convertRoman
A simple algorithm coded in JavaScript that converts roman numbers to integer.
Feel free to pull requests if you have ideas for improvements.
The only way to make the conversion is by clicking the button and the button itself does not have an appropriate icon. It would be nice to change the icon and add a "hit enter" event to the text box so it does the conversion when enter is pressed.
